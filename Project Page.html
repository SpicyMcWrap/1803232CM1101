<h2>University web Page</h2>
<p1> I have worked on various projects throughout and before uni. The first being this web page. Although it is not my best looking web page I believe in the amount of time it was done, it's pretty impressive. My chosen idle was Notepad++ because it has nice coloured text and finishes things tags off for me which is really handy. This project was so far also the most challenging as it has gone through many design iterations to make evrything to match my personal taste exactly. So every element has been adjusted at least 20 times and recoded at least 10. The hardest part was the nav bar which took a lot of effort to do, especially the javascript elements of it. The easiest part was either inseting an image or the table on the contact me page, which I feel could be made a lot better. Additionally I feel like there could be a lot more interactive elements, features, wider colour range and more fonts used. However, I believe the web page does what it's supposed to do perfectly and with minimal flaws as well as implement a few smart features that will help give it the upper hand over others.</p1><br><br>
<h2>Website for the Oil industry</h2>
<p1>About a year ago I was contacted by an oil company through one of my Dad's friends, who said he wanted to see what I could do with a web page. I took on this challenge of his and produced a very rough draft, then prototype then working web page. He liked it so I developed it using Notepad ++. It was ready after a few months, and although happy with the page, he had realised that using WIX was a lot easier and less time consuming so he decided to use that instead. I was obviously unhappy but understood that a drag and drop was a lot easier than hard coding and a prototype could easily be produced within hours rather than days, and the website could be played around with a lot easier. It was then that I realised that a person coding a website is a lot more work than a drag and drop, although more customizeable, it is less user friendly and significantly slower. With WIX it may be a lot easier to develop a website but It may not be what yo uwant exactly or have the same aesthetic as a hard coded web page. Nor is it easy to tell someone exactly what you want and expect all the elements you need to exist in WIX. So there are a lot of negatives and positives for both.</p1>
