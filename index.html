	<h2>About the Website</h2> <!--Text with the h2 tag -->
		Hello and welcome to my website. This web page was made by Andrei. This is the landing page. Above this text you can see a nav bar with fancy javascript code to make a section of it spin when you mouse over it. Most pages with text are structured using 3 columns to break up the text so it doesnt look like there is too much to read. The form on the contact me page is not working because I do not know PHP or have a working database to take the queries and actually email me back. So if you have any questions you'll just have to manually email me until I get that sorted. The nav bar is sticky, hope that adds to the cool factor. I would show that feature off on every page but I do not have enough text, unless I add filler text, so you will have to look at the source code with inspect element or Ctrl + U. I hope the website elements arent too colourful. I tried to avoid contrast as much as possible and make the web page colour blind friendly. I have made it as intuitive as I can whilst maintaining some fancy elements. You might notice that the projects on the project page are fake. This is because I haven't done many projects at all... ever. On the contact me page, you will see that I have my contact details in a picture and a table format, this is done so that I could fit a picture in somewhere and wanted it to be related to the web page. I have implemented an image slider, the images are slightly unrelated but I thought they were quite nice and I needed to add an extra feature. I hope there isn't a lack of pictures or other interactive elements. If there is, please send me a message. If you have any Ideas they are all appreciated.

	<h2>About me</h2> <!--Text with the h2 and article tag -->
		I am a student at RGU studying Cyber Security. This website was made for an assessment so that I could show what my level of webpage design and capabilities of implementing code are.
		My interests are current military conflicts around the world, the Trump administraion and medieval history, like the Crusades.
		My current hobbies are doing assignments very late at night, going to sleep at a non reasonable time and making below average rap.
		I have a pretty small family that I rarely speak about and a brother that I should probably speak to a lot more than I do.
		My brothers hobbies are currently raising a child, maintaing a happy marriage, work and playing PUBG in his little spare time. 
		In terms of career interests, I aim to join either the RAF Regiment or the Britsh Army after finishing my degree, and in time become a private contractor.
		I currently only have 1 pet, my dog, Amber. She is a cross between a golden retriever and a labrador and can either be extremely annoying or incredibly cute and adorable. She seems to be obsessed with, running around in circles when she gets excited and then ripping her toys apart
		I'm not very religious, but I don't denounce relgion and believe it has a vital role in society
		My Mum and Dad are very hardcore Christians, and sometimes make me feel like they will invoke the 10th Crusade on me if I do something that makes them angry.<br><br>
		I hope this has given you enough insight into my website and my personal life whilst maintaining a light tone.
